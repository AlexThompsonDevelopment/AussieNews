### What I learned

The main goal of building Aussie News was to create an app where I could get news from all different news sources in one location. It was a great chance to work on my networking code and challenge myself with new ideas I wished to implement. My goal with this app was to create a news app that worked effectively and efficiently, with no third party integration. All the networking, caching and data persistence was manually coded myself. 

### Accomplishments
- App built with zero third party integration
- 100% programmatic build
- App Built completely independently

## How To Use

- Clone the project to run in Xcode
